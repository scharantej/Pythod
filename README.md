## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

**1. index.html:**
- This will serve as the frontend for the application.
- Contains the HTMX code to make API calls to the Flask backend.
- Structure:
  - Header: Title and brief description of the application
  - Main section: Container for displaying dynamic content retrieved from the API
  - Footer: Contains information about the application and its creators

**2. base.html:**
- Serves as a layout template for all other HTML pages.
- Contains common elements such as the header, navigation menu, and footer.
- Ensures a consistent look and feel throughout the application

### Routes

**1. @app.route('/'):**
- Purpose: Handles requests to the root URL ('/')
- Functionality:
  - Renders the index.html page, which includes the necessary HTMX code for making API calls

**2. @app.route('/api/data'):**
- Purpose: Handles API requests for data
- Functionality:
  - Fetches data from a data source (e.g., database, third-party API)
  - Returns the data in a JSON format, which can be consumed by the HTMX code

**3. @app.route('/api/action'):**
- Purpose: Handles API requests for performing actions
- Functionality:
  - Accepts input from the frontend
  - Performs the specified action (e.g., adding a new record, updating an existing one)
  - Returns a JSON response with the result of the action

**4. Error Handling Routes:**
- @app.errorhandler(404): Handles 404 errors (page not found)
- @app.errorhandler(500): Handles 500 errors (internal server error)
- Functionality:
  - Provides a user-friendly error message
  - Logs the error for debugging purposes
